Q: Bob has planted corn in his garden, and it has just started to sprout. A week after planting it, it had grown 2 inches. The next week, its height increased by twice as much as it had the first week. In the third week, it grew 4 times as much as it did the week before. How tall are the corn plants now?
A: The second week it grew twice as much as the first week, so 2 * 2 inches = 4 inches. The third week it grew 4 times as much as in the second week, so 4 * 4 inches = 16 inches. In total, it grew 2 inches + 4 inches + 16 inches = 22 inches. The answer is 22.

Q: Benjamin is tracking how many miles he walks in a week. He walks to work and home five days a week, walks his dog twice a day every day, walks to his best friend’s house once a week, and walks to the convenience store twice a week. Work is six miles away, dog walks are two miles, his best friend’s house is one mile, and the convenience store is three miles. How many miles does Benjamin walk in a week?
A: Benjamin walks 6 miles to work and 6 miles home, so he walks 6 * 2 = 12 miles to work and home. He walks to work 5 days a week, so he walks 12 * 5 = 60 miles to work and home a week. He walks his dog 2 times a day for 2 miles, so he walks 2 * 2 = 4 miles a day for his dog. He walks his dog 7 days a week, so he walks 4 * 7 = 28 miles for his dog. He walks 3 miles to the store 2 times a week, so he walks 2 * 3 = 6 miles to the store each week. Adding his weekly 1 mile to his friend’s house, Benjamin walks 60 + 28 + 6 + 1 = 95 miles in a week. The answer is 95.

Q: In a basketball game, Tobee scored 4 points. Jay scored 6 more than Tobee and Sean scored 2 less than the points of Tobee and Jay together. If Tobee, Jay, and Sean are on the same team, how many points did they score for their team?
A: Jay scored 4 + 6 = 10 points. Together, Tobee and Jay scores 4 + 10 = 14 points. So, Sean scored 14 - 2 = 12 points. Thus, Tobee, Jay, and Sean scored a total of 4 + 10 + 12 = 26 points for their team. The answer is 26.

Q: Bobby made a big batch of soup weighing 80 kg. Each day the batch gets reduced by half. How many kg will it reach on the fourth day after he made the soup?
A: On the first day, the soup reduces down to 80 / 2 = 40 kg. On the second day, it reduces down to 40 / 2 = 20 kg. On the third day, it is reduced to 20 / 2 = 10 kg. And on the fourth day, it is finally down to 10 / 2 = 5 kg. The answer is 5.

Q: Rob and Mark plan to meet at the national park. It takes 1 hour for Rob to get to the national park and it takes three times as much time for Mark to get to the national park. If Rob leaves his home at 11 a.m., at what time should Mark leave his home so that they both arrive at the same time?
A: It takes 1 hour * 3 = 3 hours for Mark to get to the national park. The extra time it takes Mark to get to the national park is 3 hours - 1 hour = 2 hours. Mark should leave his home at 11 a.m. - 2 hours = 9 a.m. The answer is 9.
