If it takes Jerry 15 minutes to make a one-way trip from his house to his school and the school is 4 miles away, how fast does Carson run in miles per hour?\nA: First find the time Jerry takes to run from his house to his school and back: 15 minutes * 2 trips = 30 minutes. Then find the distance of Jerry\u2019s round trip: 4 miles * 2 trips = 8 miles. Then find the speed at which Jerry runs: 8 miles / 30 minutes = 0.27 miles/minute. Then convert the speed to miles per hour: 0.27 miles/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 16 miles/hour. Then divide the speed at which Jerry runs by 2 to find the speed at which Carson runs: 16 miles/hour / 2 = 8 miles/hour. The answer is 8.\n\nQ: Casey is trying to decide which employee she wants to hire. One employee works for $20 an hour. The other employee works for $22 an hour, but Casey would also get a $6/hour subsidy from the government for hiring a disabled worker. How much money per week would Casey save by hiring the cheaper employee, if they both work 40 hours per week?\nA: The cheaper employee costs $20 per hour * 40 hours per week = $800 per week. The more expensive employee costs $22 per hour * 40 hours per week - $6/hour subsidy * 40 hours per week = $22 * 40 - $6 * 40 = $880 - $240 = $640 per week.

After a few days, his mom doubled his total savings and his dad gave him an additional $10. If he now has $500, How many days have elapsed?\nA: Let the number of days be x. He saves $50 - $15 = $35 each day. After x days he had saved $35 * x = $35x. His mom doubled his savings to give $35x * 2 = $70x. His dad added $10 to give $70x + $10 = $500. Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation formed gives $70x = 490. Dividing both sides by $70 give x = 7 days. The answer is 7.\n\nQ: Tony paid $7 for 2 dozen apples and 1 bunch of bananas. Arnold paid $5 for 1 dozen apples and 1 bunch of bananas. How much does a bunch of bananas cost?\nA: Tony paid $7 - $5 = $2 more than Arnold.

If Arnold paid $5 and $2 for a dozen apples then the bunch of bananas cost $5 - $2 = $3. The answer is 3."}
{"id": "gsm_searched3", "style_template": "default", "prompt": "Q: Grant spends $200.00 a year to have the newspaper delivered daily to his house. Juanita buys the newspaper daily. Monday through Saturday, she spends $0.50 and on Sunday she spends $2.00. How much more money does Juanita spend buying the newspaper yearly than Grant?\nA: Monday through Saturday Juanita buys the paper for $0.50 so that's 6 * $0.50 = $3.00. She spends $2.00 for Sunday and $3.00 for the other 6 days so she spends $2 + $3 = $5.00 for the newspaper weekly. Over 52 weeks she spends 52 * $5 = $260.00. Juanita spends $260.00 on the newspaper for the year and Grants spends $200.00 a year so Juanita spends $260 - $200 = $60.00 more.

If Jerry won 7 games, what was the total number of games they played?\nA: With the information given we know that Ken won 5 more than Dave and Dave won 3 more than Jerry. Thus we can say that Ken = Dave + 5 and Dave = Jerry + 3. Substituting we can say that Ken = Jerry + 8. We know that Jerry won 7 games so that Ken won 7 + 8 = 15 games. We also know that Dave = Jerry + 3 so that Dave won 10 games. Thus the total number of games they played is 15 + 10 + 7 = 32.

After a few days, his mom doubled his total savings and his dad gave him an additional $10. If he now has $500, How many days have elapsed?\nA: He starts with $50. He spends $15 each day and saves the rest or $50 - $15 = $35 each day. Over x days he saves x * $35 = $35x. After his mom doubles his savings, he has 2 * $35x = $70x. After his dad gives him an additional $10, his total savings are $70x + $10 = $70x + 10. This means that $70x + 10 = $500 which means $70x = $500 - $10 = $490. $490 / $70 = 7 so he saved $35 * 7 = $245 over 7 days. The answer is 7.\n\nQ: Tony paid $7 for 2 dozen apples and 1 bunch of bananas. Arnold paid $5 for 1 dozen apples and 1 bunch of bananas.
